# File Sharing Platform (DataDock): 
### Create a secure file sharing platform where users can upload, download, and share files. Use Go for the file handling and TypeScript for the frontend.

### Steps:

- Design the application architecture
- Implement the file handling in Go
- Implement the frontend in TypeScript

For these project, you can use cloud platforms for deployment. Use version control systems like GitHub or GitLab for managing your code. For the database, you can use any SQL or NoSQL database that supports Go and TypeScript.
