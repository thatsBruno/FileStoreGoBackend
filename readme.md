# File Sharing Platform (DataDock): 
### Create a secure file sharing platform where users can upload, download, and share files. Use Go for the file handling and TypeScript for the frontend.

### Roadmap:

- Design the application architecture
- Implement the file handling in Go
    - Auth
    - Upload files
    - Download files
    - Share files
- Implement the frontend in TypeScript
- Deploy
    - Vercel/Netlify


Bugs:
    - Save file currently saves file, should download file to server and save file path
    - Both GET file reqeuests missmatch eventhough path is different
